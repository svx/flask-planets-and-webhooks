# Todo

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to create a valid OpenAPI v3 spec,
for and short reference docs about how to get started with this API.

The spec should cover the following:

- Introduction
- Endpoints and endpoint descriptions
- Tags
- `x-code` for code examples (Wget cURL HTTP)

## Goal

- A junior developer who never worked with Python should be able to follow the docs to
setup/install the application.

- The reader should be able to read through the OAS spec to understand the endpoints and to use the included
code examples.

> Disclaimer: They may be typos or non working endpoints, it is on you how to deal with these :)
Think what you should do in real life (open issue, fixing yourself).
