## üìÑ About

Sample [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/ "Flask website") App for 2-way APIs.

It serves up data about planets from [NASA data](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/in-depth/ "Link to NASA") at `/planets` and `/planets/<position>`.
It also logs the incoming data it receives to a `/webhook` endpoint.

Forked and based on [flask-planets-and-webhooks](https://github.com/lornajane/flask-planets-and-webhooks).

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Requirements

- [Python](https://www.python.org/ "Python website")
- [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/ "Link to pip")
- [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html "Link to venv docs")
- [HTTPie](https://httpie.org/ "Link to HTTPie")
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/ "Link to Postman")

We recommend [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv "Link to pyenv on GitHub") to manage multiple Python versions.

## Install

Clone the repository

### SSH

```shell
git clone git@github.com:ocular-d/flask-planets.git
```

### HTTPS

```shell
https://github.com/ocular-d/flask-planets.git
```


Change into the cloned repository

```shell
cd flask-planets
```

Switch to Python 3.8.2

```shell
pyenv local 3.8.2
```

The repository includes a Makefile for effortless installation.

```make
make venv
```

This will create a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments "Link to venv docs")
and install all needed Python packages into this environment.

After the setup is finished is it time to activate the virtual environment.

```shell
source venv/bin/activate
```

Start the application:

```shell
make run
```

If everything goes well you should see output like this:

```shell
 * Serving Flask app "app.py"
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
